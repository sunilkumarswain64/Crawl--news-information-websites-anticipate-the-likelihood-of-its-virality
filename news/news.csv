","11 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in Wuhan (File) The number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in China's Wuhan, where the virus first emerged before turning out to be a pandemic, on Sunday dropped to zero for the first time, marking yet another milestone for the city which was opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown. The result has been achieved with the ""hard efforts of medical workers in Wuhan"" and those who were dispatched to assist the city in the fight against the virus from across the country, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for China's National Health Commission (NHC). The last patient in Wuhan was cured on Friday, reducing the number of coronavirus patients in the city to zero, Mi said, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The health commission of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, said that no new confirmed cases or new deaths due to COVID-19 were reported on Saturday. The health commission of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, said that no new confirmed cases or new deaths due to COVID-19 were reported on Saturday. It said that 11 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in Wuhan. Hubei has so far reported 68,128 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 50,333 in Wuhan. Hubei and Wuhan were in the thick of the coronavirus outbreak since early January this year, bearing the brunt of it. China officially said that the coronavirus was noticed in late December in Wuhan but announced severe measures like the lockdown of 56 million-strong province from January 23, which drew criticism from the US and other countries that it acted late, leading to its spread globally. There was a controversy about whether the virus, with the ability to transmit from human-to-human, emerged from the Huanan Seafood Market of Wuhan or escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as alleged by the US. China has said that the coronavirus origin is a matter of science and it should be left to science and medical community to reach a conclusion. China also revised the death toll in Wuhan by 50 per cent amidst criticism that it is under reporting the cases. Local municipal authority said as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was increased by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869. The revised figure raised China's overall COVID-19 death toll to 4,632. The total number of cases as of Thursday stood at 82,692. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials said the revision was due to some late reports, omissions and inaccurate information in the initial stages. Officials said that over five million residents of Wuhan travelled out before the lockdown to avail the Chinese New Year holidays starting from January 24 which was cited as a possible reason for the spread of the virus in China and the world. China has highlighted the strong measures it has taken in Hubei like prolonged lockdown besides building 14 temporary hospitals and deployment of 42,000 medical personnel to contain the virus. The lockdown was lifted on April 8 after the virus cases abated. The 11 million-strong Wuhan city has not yet become fully normal due to the steady increase in asymptomatic cases. By the end of Saturday, the province had 572 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, after 19 new such cases were reported on Saturday, the local health commission reported on Sunday. Asymptomatic cases refer to the people who test positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading the virus to others. More than 200,000 people globally have died of the new coronavirus, including more than 50,000 in the US. It has infected nearly three million people across the world.

Here's Why , The Turkish city of 16 million has been under lockdown since Thursday as part of government measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus ,"The pandemic has claimed more than 2,700 lives in Turkey. A lull in boat traffic and a fishing ban in Istanbul forced by the coronavirus pandemic has proved good news for some of the city's most-loved inhabitants -- the dolphins that swim in the fish-rich waters of the Bosphorus Strait between Europe and Asia. The Turkish city of 16 million has been under lockdown since Thursday as part of government measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus, following two successive weekends where it was also shut down. The latest confinement period is due to expire on Sunday midnight. The pandemic has claimed more than 2,700 lives in Turkey. Spotting dolphins in the Bosphorus -- a usually very busy narrow waterway connecting the Mediterranean to the Black Sea right through the heart of Istanbul -- is often a source of joy for the city's residents. But the lockdown has meant fewer ships and more fish in the water, encouraging the mammals to come closer to shore and prompting more frequent sightings. ""A decrease in boat and human traffic across the Bosphorus has a big impact,"" said Erol Orkcu, head of the amateur and sports fishing association in Istanbul. ""Terrestrial and aquatic living things can remain free without human beings. That enables dolphins to come closer to the shoreline,"" he told AFP. Before the pandemic, fishing was a daily ritual in Istanbul with hundreds lighting fires or bringing samovars for making tea as they prepared for long angling stints along the shore. The sight of thousands of amateur fishers on the Galata Bridge and on the banks of the Bosphorus is one of the city's iconic images. But they are now almost deserted. - 'Terror' of fishing halted - Yoruk Isik, a dedicated ship spotter who snaps vessels passing through the Bosphorus, said he had photographed dolphins before the pandemic but now they were swimming much closer to the shore. Dolphins ""are coming closer to the edge of the water as the terror of uncontrolled anglers on the shoreline has temporarily stopped,"" he told AFP. ""I call it terror because 90 percent of them are not aware of what they are doing and cause incredible environmental pollution,"" he said. At Sarayburnu, which separates the Golden Horn from the Sea of Marmara, a pod of dolphins were spotted swimming with an army of seagulls -- to the joy of photographers. The visibility of the dolphins is seen as an indicator of a healthy maritime ecosystem as the mammals are fighting for survival. Turkish literary giant Yasar Kemal wrote about the devastation wrought on the country's coastal ecosystems by the overhunting of dolphins for oil in his 1978 novel ""The Sea-Crossed Fisherman"". Since 1983, maritime mammal hunting has been prohibited in Turkey, and dolphins are protected by law.

They were the first celebrities to reveal that they tested positive for the coronavirus last month. Last week, the couple volunteered to donate their ''blood and plasma'' for coronavirus research. ""A lot of the questions [are] what do we do now? Is there something we can do? And, in fact, we just found out that we do carry the antibodies,"" Variety quoted Hanks as saying for a podcast. The 63-year-old also added: ""We have not only been approached, but we have also said, Do you want our blood? Can we give plasma?"" The actor with much humour sense, also jokingly mentioned the name he would like to give if a vaccine for coronavirus is made from his blood donation. ""In fact, we will be giving it now to the places that hope to work on what I would like to call the ''Hank-ccine,"" the Academy Award winner added. Earlier, Wilson confirmed that while she and Hanks still do not know for sure where or from whom they contracted the virus, they've learned they were both exposed to it ""at the same time."" The ''New Girl'' songstress and Hanks were in Australia when their tests for the novel virus came back positive. Hanks had been in the land down under filming an upcoming Elvis biopic before director Baz Luhrmann suspended filming. Recently, the ""Forrest Gump"" actor detailed on how different the symptoms were for the couple and said his wife went through a tougher time than he did.

The SAARC countries have rolled out a raft of stimulus packages to boost investments, buffer private businesses and bolster growth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has upended life and disrupted economic activity in a region inhabited by over 1.8 billion people. The World Bank recently warned that South Asia faces its worst economic performance in 40 years due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic which has been wreaking havoc worldwide. It advised the governments to ""ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage now for fast economic recovery"". India, a USD 2.9 trillion economy - the biggest in the 8-member SAARC grouping, responded by unveiling a Rs 1.7 lakh crore (USD 22.6 billion) economic stimulus plan, providing direct cash transfer to poor senior citizens and women and free foodgrain and cooking gas to give relief to millions hit by the lockdown. The central bank cut the key interest rate by 75 basis points to make loans cheaper and provided Rs 1 lakh crore of liquidity to the market. Also, a moratorium on repayment of loans for three months has been provided. The government has suspended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for 6 to 12 months to give breathing space to companies trying to secure the necessary financing, renegotiating loans, and attempting to secure other reliefs from banks. In Pakistan, when Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the lockdown last month, there was little resistance initially from the private sector. But, as it prolonged, unrest slowly started brewing among small businesses and shopkeepers who feared that they may not sustain the prolonged closure. To pacify their concerns, the government announced a Rs 1.2 lakh crore rescue package to help businesses and vulnerable people. Separately, the government has decided to allocate Rs 7,500 crore for small and medium enterprises. ""We have given Rs 20,000 crore in tax refund to various businessmen so that they have money with them,"" Khan said. Pakistan's central bank has reduced the interest rate from 13.25 to 9 per cent since late March in response to the demand from the private sector. It has also agreed to give concessional loans at 4-5 per cent to businesses. Bangladesh has announced a USD 11.6 billion stimulus package to support the economy, with a primary focus on supporting the manufacturing and service sectors, agriculture and social safety nets.""This support package is equivalent to 3.5 per cent of our GDP,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Friday. The Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association has said that orders worth about USD 3.2 billion were cancelled or suspended, affecting over 2.3 million workers. The textile sector, a major forex earner, directly employs more than 4.5 million people, mostly women. Sri Lanka's economy, hit by the COVID-19, is struggling to overcome the crisis. On March 31, the central bank announced a USD 250 million refinancing facility for banks, enabling them to expand their lending capacity by Rs 40,000 crores to businesses, offer loan repayment moratoriums and provide working capital at 4 per cent interest. Sri Lanka is also planning to enter into an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India for a currency swap worth USD 400 million to boost the foreign reserves and ensure financial stability. Nepal's business sector is expected to suffer a loss of around USD 1.25 billion due to the halting of economic activities during the lockdown, says Umesh Lal Shrestha, Vice President Associate, Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Nepal's tourism sector is the worst hit by the pandemic. The Hotel Association of Nepal has projected that the hotel business income will decline by 90 per cent in 2020 and has asked the government to adopt special measures to protect the industry. The government has cancelled the ''Visit Nepal Year 2020'' that aimed to attract two million tourists, in view of the global pandemic. It has announced a relief package which includes a 25 per cent discount on electricity. The Maldives government has announced an emergency 2.5 billion Maldivian rufiyaa (USD 161.8 million) stimulus package to shore up the local economy against the coronavirus pandemic, a local media report said. The stimulus plan includes MVR 1.55 billion (USD 100 million) in emergency loans for businesses to meet short-term working capital needs. The Bank of Maldives has announced a USD 2 million short-term financing facility for the tourism industry, which contributes to the bulk of the island nation''s state revenue and foreign reserves.Bhutan''s economy is having its worst year in the recent history with the GDP growth projected to decline by anywhere between 1-2 per cent depending on how long the pandemic lasts, Kuensel newspaper quoted economic affairs minister Loknath Sharma as saying. The government wants to continue construction of hydropower projects to minimise the impact from COVID-19 and revive the land-locked country''s economy. Electricity constitutes about 13 per cent of Bhutan''s GDP, the report said. Afghanistan is a heavily aid-reliant and import-dependent economy. The coronavirus outbreak has further dented an already troubled economy. The Afghan government has allocated about USD 25 million to deal with the crisis. The World Bank has approved a USD 100.4 million grant to support the war-torn country''s weak economy.

","There have been conflicting reports about Kim Jong Un's health and whereabouts. (File) A special train possibly belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was spotted this week at a resort town in the country, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim's health and whereabouts. The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the ""leadership station"" in Wonsan on April 21 and April 23. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un's train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. ""The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,"" the report said. Satellite image with graphics taken over Wonsan, North Korea. (Reuters) Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation. A third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father's death in 2011, Kim has no clear successor in a nuclear-armed country, which could present major international risk. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump downplayed reports that Kim was ill. ""I think the report was incorrect,"" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials. Trump has met Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States as well as its Asian neighbors. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend. REPORTS AND CONTROLS Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said continuing days of North Korean media silence on Kim's whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition, and that information remained scant from a country US intelligence has long regarded as a ""black box."" The US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about the situation on Saturday. Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea on Monday as saying that Kim had undergone medical treatment in the resort county of Hyangsan north of the capital Pyongyang. It said that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. Since then, multiple South Korean media reports have cited unnamed sources this week saying that Kim might be staying in the Wonsan area. On Friday, local news agency Newsis cited South Korean intelligence sources as reporting that a special train for Kim's use had been seen in Wonsan, while Kim's private plane remained in Pyongyang. Newsis reported Kim may be sheltering from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.

","Donald Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary of Elbe River bridge link-up. (File) US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin issued a rare joint statement on Saturday commemorating a 1945 World War Two link-up of US and Soviet troops on their way to defeat Nazi Germany as an example of how their countries can cooperate. The statement by Trump and Putin comes amid deep strains in US-Russian ties over a raft of issues, from arms control and Russia's intervention in Ukraine and Syria to US charges that Russia has spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic and interfered in US election campaigns. The Wall Street Journal reported that the decision to issue the statement sparked debate within the Trump administration, with some officials worried it could undercut stern US messages to Moscow. The joint statement marked the anniversary of the April 25, 1945 meeting on a bridge over the Elbe River in Germany of Soviet soldiers advancing from the east and American troops moving from the West. ""This event heralded the decisive defeat of the Nazi regime,"" the statement said. ""The 'Spirit of the Elbe' is an example of how our countries can put aside differences, build trust, and cooperate in pursuit of a greater cause."" The Journal said the last joint statement marking the Elbe River bridge link-up was issued in 2010, when the Obama administration was seeking improved relations with Moscow. Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary. He has been complimentary of Putin, promoted cooperation with Moscow, and said he believed the Russian leader's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Senior administration officials and lawmakers, in contrast, have been fiercely critical of Russia, with relations between the nuclear-armed nations at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday issued a bipartisan report concurring with a 2017 US intelligence assessment that Russia pursued an influence campaign of misinformation and cyber hacking aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. US intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Moscow is meddling in the 2020 presidential election campaign, which Russia denies.

","He appeared to confirm media reports that he was considering halting the briefings. President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that his daily coronavirus briefings were not worth his time, two days after sparking a furor by suggesting patients might be injected with disinfectant to kill an infection. He appeared to confirm media reports that he was considering halting the briefings, which dominate early-evening cable television news for sometimes more than two hours, out of frustration with questions about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,"" Trump wrote. ""They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!"" On Thursday the US leader stunned viewers by saying doctors might treat people infected with the coronavirus by shining ultraviolet light inside their bodies, or with injections of household disinfectant. ""Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks (the virus) out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs,"" he said. After a strong rebuff of his suggestion by top medical experts and disinfectant manufacturers, Trump on Friday claimed he had been speaking ""sarcastically."" But he limited that day's briefing, which usually includes himself, Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to just 19 minutes, and did not take any questions from reporters. And on Saturday, after 50 briefings over two months, the White House did not hold one at all. Trump has used the briefings to occupy television screens and promote his administration's policies, fend off critics and attack political rivals -- from opposition Democrats to China to the US media. But after more than 53,000 Americans have died from the novel coronavirus, the briefings, opinion polls suggest, have not bolstered Trump's popularity among voters as he gears up to battle Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential election in November. An AP-NORC poll published Thursday showed that most Americans -- and a crushing majority of Democrats -- don't believe Trump when it comes to the health emergency facing the country.

Hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world spent the second day of the Ramadan holy month out of mosques and avoiding large family meals to break the fast because of sequestration and social distancing policies. And Australians and New Zealanders marked Anzac Day without the normal parades and public ceremonies to commemorate fallen soldiers. Instead, under social distancing policies, people held dawn vigils in front of their homes. Even as governments from Sri Lanka to Belgium to the United States began moving in the direction of partial reopening, the COVID-19 pandemic still had nearly half of humanity under some form of lockdown or confinement. Total cases around the world rose to 2.86 million and deaths mounted past the 200,000 mark, doubling since April 10, according to an AFP tally. Europe, the hardest-hit region, has recorded 122,171 coronavirus deaths. The United States has seen the highest number of deaths for a single country with 53,070 fatalities, followed by Italy at 26,384, Spain 22,902, France 22,614 and the United Kingdom 20,319. Reinfection warning The world remained in wait as companies and governments raced to develop treatments and, further down the road, a vaccine for the virus, which first surfaced in China late last year. The WHO warned on Saturday that people who test positive and survive infection cannot be certain they will not be hit again by the coronavirus. The warning came as some governments study measures such as ""immunity passports"" for those who have recovered as one way to get people back to work after weeks of economic shutdown. ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,"" the UN health body said in a statement. It warned that such people may tend to ignore public health advice, such as continuing to wear facemasks, assuming they are not a danger to themselves or others. That is a particular worry as testing becomes more widespread, especially testing for coronavirus antibodies, whose presence indicate a person had previously contracted the virus and recovered. ""If I've already had corona then I'm not infectious,"" said Berlin resident Lothar Kopp, hoping to test positive for antibodies as it could allow him to visit his elderly mother. Germany has carried out tens of thousands of tests and other countries are also working on determining so-called levels of immunity. - Early stages - Despite Saturday's grim milestone in virus fatalities, the daily count in Western countries appeared to be levelling off and even falling, a sign hopeful epidemiologists had been looking for. Likewise, new reported cases appear to have plateaued at about 80,000 a day. But in many countries there were worries of a second surge after lockdown restrictions are eased, possibly also coinciding with a new flu season. In hard-hit Iran, health officials Saturday raised fears of a ""fresh outbreak"" with another 76 fatalities declared, bringing the country's official death count to 5,650. Iran has steadily allowed the restarting of businesses that were closed to stop the virus spread. But Alireza Zali, a health coordinator for the capital, criticised ""hasty reopenings"" that could ""create new waves of sickness in Tehran"". In the United States, the White House's top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said this week that the US will certainly have a coronavirus problem in the fall, which could be complicated by the return of the seasonal flu toward year-end. - At the beach - Even so, the pressure from broken economies and citizens frustrated by stay-at-home orders had areas pushing to open up. The governor of the US state of Georgia rejected warnings from top disease experts and allowed businesses like hair dressers, nail salons and bowling alleys to reopen. On Saturday many Georgians embraced the return to something resembling normalcy by flocking to the beach. ""It feels great -- like it's supposed to feel,"" mother and housewife Rachel Lilly, 39, told AFP, barely lifting her head from her watermelon-themed towel as she relaxed under a cloudless sky on Tybee Island. ""I'm not concerned"" about catching coronavirus, ""as long as it's not packed,"" she said. ""But if everyone does what we're doing, that's a problem."" On Friday, Belgium's Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced a staggered plan for reopening businesses and schools in mid-May and restaurants beginning on June 8. ""The spread of COVID-19 has been slowed down, but the virus has not disappeared,"" she warned. Italy, nearing the end of the world's longest active lockdown, announced plans Saturday to set price limits on face masks and ramp up antibody testing. Italians are awaiting a decision this weekend about which restrictions will be lifted. They will probably be allowed to leave their homes freely for the first time since March 9 by early May. In France, which will be on lockdown until May 11, residents have taken to praising health workers and protesting their frustrations with painted banners hung outside their windows. ""Thank you to the caregivers, shame on the leaders,"" read one banner hanging outside a building in a Paris suburb.

","The number of people in intensive is dropping for the 17th day in a row. (Representational) France reported 369 more coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a drop on previous days, with the number of people in intensive care falling for the 17th day in a row. While 22,614 people have died from the virus in France since the beginning of March, health officials said the mortality rate in hospitals was the lowest in a month, with 198 deaths in 24 hours. However, 171 died in retirement and care homes, and officials said they were worried by an increase in critically ill patients suffering from other conditions. More than 7,500 people are now being treated in the intensive care units across France -- which is 50 percent more than the country's total capacity before the epidemic struck. Despite some encouraging, the system was still under strain, officials said. ""The rise in the number of patients in intensive care shows the necessity for those with chronic diseases to be looked after as well as taking care of those in emergency situations,"" a statement said. ""If the care... (of those with chronic problems) is interrupted for a long time, their illnesses will become more serious.""

China had been stipulating such approval since the end of March after several European countries complained that Chinese-made test kits were inaccurate, in effect hampering many firms' efforts to supply global efforts against the coronavirus pandemic. The new ruling applies to products such as coronavirus tests, medical masks, protective suits, infrared thermometers and ventilators. ""Tonight's new rule is a revision to (the older rule),"" said Zhang Shuwen, the CEO of Liming Bio-products, a biotech firm offering coronavirus tests targeting the overseas market. ""It's wrong to have a one-size-fits-all policy...Each country may have different criteria for medicines and medical devices. The priority is to meet the requirement in the countries where the product will be sold, instead of where the product is made,"" Zhang said. The previous ban vexed medical device firms in the cities of Hangzhou and Shenzhen, who tried to seek help from local governments, Zhang added.

Health department figures showed a further 813 people had died in hospital after contracting COVID-19, pushing the official number of fatalities to 20,319. The medical director of NHS England Stephen Powis and the UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, had earlier said that keeping the number of fatalities lower than 20,000 would be ""a good outcome"". ""The nation today will be deeply moved by the figures of the number of people who have died,"" Patel said during the daily Downing Street briefing. ""Every death is a tragedy."" She added: ""This is a deeply tragic and moving moment."" Saturday's count was an increase on the 684 deaths reported the previous day and comes after the government claimed the virus had hit its peak. However, there was some optimism as those diagnosed as having contracted the virus fell by 473 to 4,913, according to the same health department figures. University of Oxford analysis also showed that the numbers dying in England may be on a downward spiral as it said a third of the 711 additional deaths recorded in the latest government figures on Saturday occurred more than a week ago. Despite that, the latest figures confirm Britain has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world and the actual death toll could be much higher when deaths in the community are taken into account, particularly at care homes. The UK government has been under pressure to relax social distancing rules since the country went into lockdown on March 23, but Patel said ministers would not yet give a date for any relaxation in the regulations. ""We've made a great deal of progress, but actually we're not out of the woods yet, we really are not,"" she said. The lockdown was extended on April 16 and is due for review on May 7. Questions have been raised over shortages in personal protective equipment and a lack of widespread testing, particularly of frontline health and social care workers. Concern over political influence Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was also embroiled in a political row after it emerged his chief advisor attended meetings of the main scientific group advising ministers on the coronavirus pandemic in Britain. Downing Street was forced to deny that Dominic Cummings and another advisor, Ben Warner, were members of the politically independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). However, following reports in The Guardian newspaper, the government admitted that Cummings had sat in on group meetings. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman said: ""It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are 'on' or members of SAGE"", and said they attended meetings ""to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency"". The statement added it was ""factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate"" to suggest the committee's advice was affected by the government. Labour's health spokesman, John Ashworth told BBC radio on Saturday that his ""concern"" was ""that political advisers have influenced the debate"". And a former Conservative frontbencher, David Davis, tweeted that ""we should publish the membership of SAGE: remove any non-scientist members"". Meanwhile on Saturday, health officials announced that as many as 5,000 severely ill coronavirus patients could be treated with plasma from people who have recovered from the illness as part of a new approach.

Instead of playing sports -- skiing, swimming and karate -- I have to make do with an exercise bike."" That led Lupo to turn his attention to progamming, a passion that he shares with his father Marco, a business manager.  He took some online tutorials and set to work on building his game -- Cerba-20.  The aim of the game is a fairly typical 'seek and destroy' with lasers, except in this case, the player is in the captain's chair of the Cerba-20 spacecraft and the enemy is, that's right, COVID-19.  Lupo explains that he plays with his friends and that he now intends to set up a project to teach them how to programme. ""He also receives requests from his teachers to programme something useful, not just games,"" says his father. Many parents with children who have been gorging themselves on video games during lockdown might be concerned by Lupo's new interest..But his mother, a lawyer, dismisses such anxieties.

(Representational) An Ecuadoran woman who was pronounced dead of COVID-19 suddenly woke up in the hospital, to the delight and relief of relatives who had identified someone else's body as hers and had it cremated. Alba Maruri, 74, was hospitalized in March in Guayaquil, the Ecuadoran city hardest hit by the pandemic, with fever and trouble breathing. She lost consciousness for three weeks and was declared dead on March 27, relatives said. A week later, her family was shown a corpse in the hospital morgue, but for fear of coronavirus contagion did not get close to it. The body was on its side, with the back showing, not the face. Maruri's nephew Jaime Morla said he thought it was his aunt and told hospital officials it was. ""I was afraid to see her face,"" he told AFP. ""I was a meter and a half away. She had the same hair, the same skin tone. She even had a wound like one my aunt had recently,"" Morla said. That body was taken to a funeral home and cremated. Maruri regained consciousness Thursday and told doctors who she was and had them call her sister Aura. ""The doctors went to my aunt's house to corroborate and inform them of the mistake,"" said another nephew, Juan Carlos Ramirez. ""They still do not know whose ashes they have in their house,"" he added. The family plans to sue the hospital to recover the cremation fee they paid and for the distress caused by the mix-up. The sister told Ecuadoran news outlets that hospital officials visited her Friday and told her that her sister was well and about to be released. ""It is a miracle. For nearly a month we thought she was dead. Imagine.  ""And I have someone else's ashes,"" said Aura.

","Trump made it clear that physicians must study his idea, Dr Deborah Brix said. US President Donald Trump's remarks that disinfectants could potentially treat coronavirus patients remaining in the news after four days of them being made was ""bothering"", a key member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus has said. ""I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we're missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing, as American people, to continue to protect one another,"" Dr Deborah Brix, member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, told CNN in an interview. Trump on Wednesday had suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light ""inside"" their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation. Brix, a leading doctor specialising in HIV/AIDS immunology, said the dialogue should focus on asymptomatic cases and not on the president's remarks. ""We should be having that dialogue about this unique clotting that we're seeing. We are the first country that really had young people to this degree. Italy and Europe is about eight years older than us, as a median age. ""So, this is the first experience of this virus in an open society, where we really can understand what's happening to every different age group. These are the things that we should be talking about and focusing on,"" Brix said. ""As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes, I worry that we don't get the information to the American people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night,"" she said. Responding to a question, Brix said Trump made it clear that physicians must study his idea. ""I think I have made it clear that this was a musing. But I want us to move on to be able to get information to the American people that can help them protect each other and also help them understand how devastating this virus is to different age groups and different symptoms and different comorbidities,"" she said. Dr Brix said that she is ""always concerned"" when asked about a potential surge in new cases and deaths after many states have started taking actions to open up their economy. ""I'm always concerned. And that's why we put out key, key gating criteria. And that gating criteria was not only looking at the epidemic. It was looking at the health care workers and making sure that the health care workers were protected. And it was also looking at capacity within the hospitals,"" she said. Noting that over the last few weeks there is a better understand how much asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic spread may be out there, Dr Brix underscored the need for sentinel surveillance, monitoring proactively in long-term care facilities, in inner-city clinics that have multi-generational households, in prisons, among Native Americans, to really ensure to find the virus before people even get symptoms. ""And that's a key part of this also that, sometimes, I think is missing when we''re talking about diagnosis and contact tracing. We also have to diagnose the virus before it is evident in communities,"" she said.

The number of people who have died from the virus has risen by 413 to 20,732, officials said Sunday, the lowest reported daily increase in fatalities in all of April. The last time the health department recorded a smaller increase was on March 31, at 381 deaths.  Despite the slowdown -- which came at a weekend when the toll has often been lower -- Environment Secretary George Eustice said now was not the time to relax strict social distancing rules. ""There are encouraging signs of progress,"" he said at the daily Downing Street press briefing.  ""But before we consider it safe to adjust any of the current system distancing measures, we must be satisfied that we have met the five tests set last week."" These included making sure the British health service NHS was able to cope, and a ""sustained and consistent"" fall in the daily death rate. The UK was initially placed into lockdown on March 23. This was extended on April 16 and a review is due on May 7. Eustice echoed statements made by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab -- who has been deputising for Boris Johnson as the prime minister recovers from contracting the virus -- earlier on Sunday that the lockdown rules would ""be with us for some time"" and were the ""new normal"". Raab told the BBC: ""We do want to look at when it's safe, when it's responsible, at ways to allow more outside activities to take place but, again, we have got to have the evidence that it's a surefooted step and doesn't allow the coronavirus to get a grip back on the country."" There have been calls for the rules to be relaxed from within the ruling Conservative Party. The new opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer meanwhile wrote to Johnson on Sunday asking for details on a potential lifting of restrictions. He accused the government of ""mistakes"" at the beginning of the crisis and added: ""The government cannot fall short in its preparations for what happens when the time is right for lockdown measures to be lifted."" Sunday's figures also showed another 4,463 people had tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to almost 153,000. Johnson returning Raab told Sky News that Johnson would be back in his Downing Street office on Monday after recovering and was in ""good spirits"" and ""raring to go"". He has been recuperating at the British prime ministerial retreat, Chequers, outside London since his release from hospital on April 12.

","11 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in Wuhan (File) The number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in China's Wuhan, where the virus first emerged before turning out to be a pandemic, on Sunday dropped to zero for the first time, marking yet another milestone for the city which was opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown. The result has been achieved with the ""hard efforts of medical workers in Wuhan"" and those who were dispatched to assist the city in the fight against the virus from across the country, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for China's National Health Commission (NHC). The last patient in Wuhan was cured on Friday, reducing the number of coronavirus patients in the city to zero, Mi said, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The health commission of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, said that no new confirmed cases or new deaths due to COVID-19 were reported on Saturday. The health commission of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, said that no new confirmed cases or new deaths due to COVID-19 were reported on Saturday. It said that 11 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in Wuhan. Hubei has so far reported 68,128 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 50,333 in Wuhan. Hubei and Wuhan were in the thick of the coronavirus outbreak since early January this year, bearing the brunt of it. China officially said that the coronavirus was noticed in late December in Wuhan but announced severe measures like the lockdown of 56 million-strong province from January 23, which drew criticism from the US and other countries that it acted late, leading to its spread globally. There was a controversy about whether the virus, with the ability to transmit from human-to-human, emerged from the Huanan Seafood Market of Wuhan or escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) as alleged by the US. China has said that the coronavirus origin is a matter of science and it should be left to science and medical community to reach a conclusion. China also revised the death toll in Wuhan by 50 per cent amidst criticism that it is under reporting the cases. Local municipal authority said as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was increased by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869. The revised figure raised China's overall COVID-19 death toll to 4,632. The total number of cases as of Thursday stood at 82,692. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials said the revision was due to some late reports, omissions and inaccurate information in the initial stages. Officials said that over five million residents of Wuhan travelled out before the lockdown to avail the Chinese New Year holidays starting from January 24 which was cited as a possible reason for the spread of the virus in China and the world. China has highlighted the strong measures it has taken in Hubei like prolonged lockdown besides building 14 temporary hospitals and deployment of 42,000 medical personnel to contain the virus. The lockdown was lifted on April 8 after the virus cases abated. The 11 million-strong Wuhan city has not yet become fully normal due to the steady increase in asymptomatic cases. By the end of Saturday, the province had 572 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, after 19 new such cases were reported on Saturday, the local health commission reported on Sunday. Asymptomatic cases refer to the people who test positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading the virus to others. More than 200,000 people globally have died of the new coronavirus, including more than 50,000 in the US. It has infected nearly three million people across the world.

Here's Why , The Turkish city of 16 million has been under lockdown since Thursday as part of government measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus ,"The pandemic has claimed more than 2,700 lives in Turkey. A lull in boat traffic and a fishing ban in Istanbul forced by the coronavirus pandemic has proved good news for some of the city's most-loved inhabitants -- the dolphins that swim in the fish-rich waters of the Bosphorus Strait between Europe and Asia. The Turkish city of 16 million has been under lockdown since Thursday as part of government measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus, following two successive weekends where it was also shut down. The latest confinement period is due to expire on Sunday midnight. The pandemic has claimed more than 2,700 lives in Turkey. Spotting dolphins in the Bosphorus -- a usually very busy narrow waterway connecting the Mediterranean to the Black Sea right through the heart of Istanbul -- is often a source of joy for the city's residents. But the lockdown has meant fewer ships and more fish in the water, encouraging the mammals to come closer to shore and prompting more frequent sightings. ""A decrease in boat and human traffic across the Bosphorus has a big impact,"" said Erol Orkcu, head of the amateur and sports fishing association in Istanbul. ""Terrestrial and aquatic living things can remain free without human beings. That enables dolphins to come closer to the shoreline,"" he told AFP. Before the pandemic, fishing was a daily ritual in Istanbul with hundreds lighting fires or bringing samovars for making tea as they prepared for long angling stints along the shore. The sight of thousands of amateur fishers on the Galata Bridge and on the banks of the Bosphorus is one of the city's iconic images. But they are now almost deserted. - 'Terror' of fishing halted - Yoruk Isik, a dedicated ship spotter who snaps vessels passing through the Bosphorus, said he had photographed dolphins before the pandemic but now they were swimming much closer to the shore. Dolphins ""are coming closer to the edge of the water as the terror of uncontrolled anglers on the shoreline has temporarily stopped,"" he told AFP. ""I call it terror because 90 percent of them are not aware of what they are doing and cause incredible environmental pollution,"" he said. At Sarayburnu, which separates the Golden Horn from the Sea of Marmara, a pod of dolphins were spotted swimming with an army of seagulls -- to the joy of photographers. The visibility of the dolphins is seen as an indicator of a healthy maritime ecosystem as the mammals are fighting for survival. Turkish literary giant Yasar Kemal wrote about the devastation wrought on the country's coastal ecosystems by the overhunting of dolphins for oil in his 1978 novel ""The Sea-Crossed Fisherman"". Since 1983, maritime mammal hunting has been prohibited in Turkey, and dolphins are protected by law.

They were the first celebrities to reveal that they tested positive for the coronavirus last month. Last week, the couple volunteered to donate their ''blood and plasma'' for coronavirus research. ""A lot of the questions [are] what do we do now? Is there something we can do? And, in fact, we just found out that we do carry the antibodies,"" Variety quoted Hanks as saying for a podcast. The 63-year-old also added: ""We have not only been approached, but we have also said, Do you want our blood? Can we give plasma?"" The actor with much humour sense, also jokingly mentioned the name he would like to give if a vaccine for coronavirus is made from his blood donation. ""In fact, we will be giving it now to the places that hope to work on what I would like to call the ''Hank-ccine,"" the Academy Award winner added. Earlier, Wilson confirmed that while she and Hanks still do not know for sure where or from whom they contracted the virus, they've learned they were both exposed to it ""at the same time."" The ''New Girl'' songstress and Hanks were in Australia when their tests for the novel virus came back positive. Hanks had been in the land down under filming an upcoming Elvis biopic before director Baz Luhrmann suspended filming. Recently, the ""Forrest Gump"" actor detailed on how different the symptoms were for the couple and said his wife went through a tougher time than he did.

The SAARC countries have rolled out a raft of stimulus packages to boost investments, buffer private businesses and bolster growth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has upended life and disrupted economic activity in a region inhabited by over 1.8 billion people. The World Bank recently warned that South Asia faces its worst economic performance in 40 years due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic which has been wreaking havoc worldwide. It advised the governments to ""ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage now for fast economic recovery"". India, a USD 2.9 trillion economy - the biggest in the 8-member SAARC grouping, responded by unveiling a Rs 1.7 lakh crore (USD 22.6 billion) economic stimulus plan, providing direct cash transfer to poor senior citizens and women and free foodgrain and cooking gas to give relief to millions hit by the lockdown. The central bank cut the key interest rate by 75 basis points to make loans cheaper and provided Rs 1 lakh crore of liquidity to the market. Also, a moratorium on repayment of loans for three months has been provided. The government has suspended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for 6 to 12 months to give breathing space to companies trying to secure the necessary financing, renegotiating loans, and attempting to secure other reliefs from banks. In Pakistan, when Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the lockdown last month, there was little resistance initially from the private sector. But, as it prolonged, unrest slowly started brewing among small businesses and shopkeepers who feared that they may not sustain the prolonged closure. To pacify their concerns, the government announced a Rs 1.2 lakh crore rescue package to help businesses and vulnerable people. Separately, the government has decided to allocate Rs 7,500 crore for small and medium enterprises. ""We have given Rs 20,000 crore in tax refund to various businessmen so that they have money with them,"" Khan said. Pakistan's central bank has reduced the interest rate from 13.25 to 9 per cent since late March in response to the demand from the private sector. It has also agreed to give concessional loans at 4-5 per cent to businesses. Bangladesh has announced a USD 11.6 billion stimulus package to support the economy, with a primary focus on supporting the manufacturing and service sectors, agriculture and social safety nets.""This support package is equivalent to 3.5 per cent of our GDP,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Friday. The Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association has said that orders worth about USD 3.2 billion were cancelled or suspended, affecting over 2.3 million workers. The textile sector, a major forex earner, directly employs more than 4.5 million people, mostly women. Sri Lanka's economy, hit by the COVID-19, is struggling to overcome the crisis. On March 31, the central bank announced a USD 250 million refinancing facility for banks, enabling them to expand their lending capacity by Rs 40,000 crores to businesses, offer loan repayment moratoriums and provide working capital at 4 per cent interest. Sri Lanka is also planning to enter into an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India for a currency swap worth USD 400 million to boost the foreign reserves and ensure financial stability. Nepal's business sector is expected to suffer a loss of around USD 1.25 billion due to the halting of economic activities during the lockdown, says Umesh Lal Shrestha, Vice President Associate, Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Nepal's tourism sector is the worst hit by the pandemic. The Hotel Association of Nepal has projected that the hotel business income will decline by 90 per cent in 2020 and has asked the government to adopt special measures to protect the industry. The government has cancelled the ''Visit Nepal Year 2020'' that aimed to attract two million tourists, in view of the global pandemic. It has announced a relief package which includes a 25 per cent discount on electricity. The Maldives government has announced an emergency 2.5 billion Maldivian rufiyaa (USD 161.8 million) stimulus package to shore up the local economy against the coronavirus pandemic, a local media report said. The stimulus plan includes MVR 1.55 billion (USD 100 million) in emergency loans for businesses to meet short-term working capital needs. The Bank of Maldives has announced a USD 2 million short-term financing facility for the tourism industry, which contributes to the bulk of the island nation''s state revenue and foreign reserves.Bhutan''s economy is having its worst year in the recent history with the GDP growth projected to decline by anywhere between 1-2 per cent depending on how long the pandemic lasts, Kuensel newspaper quoted economic affairs minister Loknath Sharma as saying. The government wants to continue construction of hydropower projects to minimise the impact from COVID-19 and revive the land-locked country''s economy. Electricity constitutes about 13 per cent of Bhutan''s GDP, the report said. Afghanistan is a heavily aid-reliant and import-dependent economy. The coronavirus outbreak has further dented an already troubled economy. The Afghan government has allocated about USD 25 million to deal with the crisis. The World Bank has approved a USD 100.4 million grant to support the war-torn country''s weak economy.

","There have been conflicting reports about Kim Jong Un's health and whereabouts. (File) A special train possibly belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was spotted this week at a resort town in the country, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim's health and whereabouts. The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the ""leadership station"" in Wonsan on April 21 and April 23. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un's train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. ""The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,"" the report said. Satellite image with graphics taken over Wonsan, North Korea. (Reuters) Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation. A third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father's death in 2011, Kim has no clear successor in a nuclear-armed country, which could present major international risk. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump downplayed reports that Kim was ill. ""I think the report was incorrect,"" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials. Trump has met Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States as well as its Asian neighbors. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend. REPORTS AND CONTROLS Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said continuing days of North Korean media silence on Kim's whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition, and that information remained scant from a country US intelligence has long regarded as a ""black box."" The US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about the situation on Saturday. Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea on Monday as saying that Kim had undergone medical treatment in the resort county of Hyangsan north of the capital Pyongyang. It said that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. Since then, multiple South Korean media reports have cited unnamed sources this week saying that Kim might be staying in the Wonsan area. On Friday, local news agency Newsis cited South Korean intelligence sources as reporting that a special train for Kim's use had been seen in Wonsan, while Kim's private plane remained in Pyongyang. Newsis reported Kim may be sheltering from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.

11,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-russias-vladimir-putin-issue-rare-joint-statement-on-cooperation-2218385," Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin Issue Rare Joint Statement On Cooperation "," The statement by Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin comes amid deep strains in US-Russian ties over a raft of issues, like arms control and Russia's intervention in Ukraine and Syria, and in US elections. ","Donald Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary of Elbe River bridge link-up. (File) US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin issued a rare joint statement on Saturday commemorating a 1945 World War Two link-up of US and Soviet troops on their way to defeat Nazi Germany as an example of how their countries can cooperate. The statement by Trump and Putin comes amid deep strains in US-Russian ties over a raft of issues, from arms control and Russia's intervention in Ukraine and Syria to US charges that Russia has spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic and interfered in US election campaigns. The Wall Street Journal reported that the decision to issue the statement sparked debate within the Trump administration, with some officials worried it could undercut stern US messages to Moscow. The joint statement marked the anniversary of the April 25, 1945 meeting on a bridge over the Elbe River in Germany of Soviet soldiers advancing from the east and American troops moving from the West. ""This event heralded the decisive defeat of the Nazi regime,"" the statement said. ""The 'Spirit of the Elbe' is an example of how our countries can put aside differences, build trust, and cooperate in pursuit of a greater cause."" The Journal said the last joint statement marking the Elbe River bridge link-up was issued in 2010, when the Obama administration was seeking improved relations with Moscow. Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary. He has been complimentary of Putin, promoted cooperation with Moscow, and said he believed the Russian leader's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Senior administration officials and lawmakers, in contrast, have been fiercely critical of Russia, with relations between the nuclear-armed nations at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday issued a bipartisan report concurring with a 2017 US intelligence assessment that Russia pursued an influence campaign of misinformation and cyber hacking aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. US intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Moscow is meddling in the 2020 presidential election campaign, which Russia denies.

","He appeared to confirm media reports that he was considering halting the briefings. President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that his daily coronavirus briefings were not worth his time, two days after sparking a furor by suggesting patients might be injected with disinfectant to kill an infection. He appeared to confirm media reports that he was considering halting the briefings, which dominate early-evening cable television news for sometimes more than two hours, out of frustration with questions about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,"" Trump wrote. ""They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!"" On Thursday the US leader stunned viewers by saying doctors might treat people infected with the coronavirus by shining ultraviolet light inside their bodies, or with injections of household disinfectant. ""Then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks (the virus) out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs,"" he said. After a strong rebuff of his suggestion by top medical experts and disinfectant manufacturers, Trump on Friday claimed he had been speaking ""sarcastically."" But he limited that day's briefing, which usually includes himself, Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to just 19 minutes, and did not take any questions from reporters. And on Saturday, after 50 briefings over two months, the White House did not hold one at all. Trump has used the briefings to occupy television screens and promote his administration's policies, fend off critics and attack political rivals -- from opposition Democrats to China to the US media. But after more than 53,000 Americans have died from the novel coronavirus, the briefings, opinion polls suggest, have not bolstered Trump's popularity among voters as he gears up to battle Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential election in November. An AP-NORC poll published Thursday showed that most Americans -- and a crushing majority of Democrats -- don't believe Trump when it comes to the health emergency facing the country.

13,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/covid-19-death-count-global-coronavirus-death-count-crosses-2-lakhs-who-warns-over-immunity-2218355," Global Coronavirus Death Count Crosses 2 Lakhs, WHO Warns Over Immunity ", Hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world spent the second day of the Ramadan holy month out of mosques and avoiding large family meals to break the fast because of sequestration and social distancing policies. ,"The World Health Organization warned on Saturday that recovery from coronavirus might not protect a person from reinfection as the global death count from the pandemic surpassed 2,00,000. Hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world spent the second day of the Ramadan holy month out of mosques and avoiding large family meals to break the fast because of sequestration and social distancing policies. And Australians and New Zealanders marked Anzac Day without the normal parades and public ceremonies to commemorate fallen soldiers. Instead, under social distancing policies, people held dawn vigils in front of their homes. Even as governments from Sri Lanka to Belgium to the United States began moving in the direction of partial reopening, the COVID-19 pandemic still had nearly half of humanity under some form of lockdown or confinement. Total cases around the world rose to 2.86 million and deaths mounted past the 200,000 mark, doubling since April 10, according to an AFP tally. Europe, the hardest-hit region, has recorded 122,171 coronavirus deaths. The United States has seen the highest number of deaths for a single country with 53,070 fatalities, followed by Italy at 26,384, Spain 22,902, France 22,614 and the United Kingdom 20,319. Reinfection warning The world remained in wait as companies and governments raced to develop treatments and, further down the road, a vaccine for the virus, which first surfaced in China late last year. The WHO warned on Saturday that people who test positive and survive infection cannot be certain they will not be hit again by the coronavirus. The warning came as some governments study measures such as ""immunity passports"" for those who have recovered as one way to get people back to work after weeks of economic shutdown. ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,"" the UN health body said in a statement. It warned that such people may tend to ignore public health advice, such as continuing to wear facemasks, assuming they are not a danger to themselves or others. That is a particular worry as testing becomes more widespread, especially testing for coronavirus antibodies, whose presence indicate a person had previously contracted the virus and recovered. ""If I've already had corona then I'm not infectious,"" said Berlin resident Lothar Kopp, hoping to test positive for antibodies as it could allow him to visit his elderly mother. Germany has carried out tens of thousands of tests and other countries are also working on determining so-called levels of immunity. - Early stages - Despite Saturday's grim milestone in virus fatalities, the daily count in Western countries appeared to be levelling off and even falling, a sign hopeful epidemiologists had been looking for. Likewise, new reported cases appear to have plateaued at about 80,000 a day. But in many countries there were worries of a second surge after lockdown restrictions are eased, possibly also coinciding with a new flu season. In hard-hit Iran, health officials Saturday raised fears of a ""fresh outbreak"" with another 76 fatalities declared, bringing the country's official death count to 5,650. Iran has steadily allowed the restarting of businesses that were closed to stop the virus spread. But Alireza Zali, a health coordinator for the capital, criticised ""hasty reopenings"" that could ""create new waves of sickness in Tehran"". In the United States, the White House's top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said this week that the US will certainly have a coronavirus problem in the fall, which could be complicated by the return of the seasonal flu toward year-end. - At the beach - Even so, the pressure from broken economies and citizens frustrated by stay-at-home orders had areas pushing to open up. The governor of the US state of Georgia rejected warnings from top disease experts and allowed businesses like hair dressers, nail salons and bowling alleys to reopen. On Saturday many Georgians embraced the return to something resembling normalcy by flocking to the beach. ""It feels great -- like it's supposed to feel,"" mother and housewife Rachel Lilly, 39, told AFP, barely lifting her head from her watermelon-themed towel as she relaxed under a cloudless sky on Tybee Island. ""I'm not concerned"" about catching coronavirus, ""as long as it's not packed,"" she said. ""But if everyone does what we're doing, that's a problem."" On Friday, Belgium's Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced a staggered plan for reopening businesses and schools in mid-May and restaurants beginning on June 8. ""The spread of COVID-19 has been slowed down, but the virus has not disappeared,"" she warned. Italy, nearing the end of the world's longest active lockdown, announced plans Saturday to set price limits on face masks and ramp up antibody testing. Italians are awaiting a decision this weekend about which restrictions will be lifted. They will probably be allowed to leave their homes freely for the first time since March 9 by early May. In France, which will be on lockdown until May 11, residents have taken to praising health workers and protesting their frustrations with painted banners hung outside their windows. ""Thank you to the caregivers, shame on the leaders,"" read one banner hanging outside a building in a Paris suburb.

","The number of people in intensive is dropping for the 17th day in a row. (Representational) France reported 369 more coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a drop on previous days, with the number of people in intensive care falling for the 17th day in a row. While 22,614 people have died from the virus in France since the beginning of March, health officials said the mortality rate in hospitals was the lowest in a month, with 198 deaths in 24 hours. However, 171 died in retirement and care homes, and officials said they were worried by an increase in critically ill patients suffering from other conditions. More than 7,500 people are now being treated in the intensive care units across France -- which is 50 percent more than the country's total capacity before the epidemic struck. Despite some encouraging, the system was still under strain, officials said. ""The rise in the number of patients in intensive care shows the necessity for those with chronic diseases to be looked after as well as taking care of those in emergency situations,"" a statement said. ""If the care... (of those with chronic problems) is interrupted for a long time, their illnesses will become more serious."" Officials urged people with chronic diseases who are sick not to be afraid of contacting their doctors or medical carers.
